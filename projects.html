                                I and 3 other developers made a search engine!
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Cool, right? To summarize, the engine worked 
                                by reverse indexing websites already scraped from the 
                                university's CS department. Tokens were gathered 
                                from webpages and ranked to determine relevance 
                                when returning results. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I worked on the ranking portion and decided on 
                                using cosine similarity to compare tokens/key words. 
                                Websites were made multi-dimensonal as vectors that 
                                had angles based on tokens on the site.

                                Search queries also were vectors. The website vectors 
                                closest to the query vectors are returned.     
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                Some problems we ran into included:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>
                                    not knowing Git/Github. This was huge as I had 
                                    to learn how to set up pull requests and developer 
                                    branches as our commit history got really messy 
                                    without it. It also helped prevent frustration 
                                    due to overriding the commits of others. 
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>
                                    edge case/similar searches like "ICS33" 
                                    and "ICS 33" or "software engineering" 
                                    and "master of software engineering". 
                                    Breaking tokens up in multiple ways helped 
                                    make more accurate vectors for cosine similarity.
                                    Some keywords were also hardcoded to boost 
                                    higher rankings for certain websites. That could 
                                    be used for SEO xD!
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li><p>
                                    nonsensical searches like "ASKJHDAIYS12342$@#!". 
                                    These delayed search time so we added an upper 
                                    limit for how many comparisons we did.
                                    </p></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> Unfortunately, it costs money to host the Python backend, but here are example searches below.</p>
