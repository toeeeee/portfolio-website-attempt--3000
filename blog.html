                <p id="first"> so i'm almost "done" with this website and it's been really fun- i learned a lot from the internet. 
                    it is so cool that i can just pick a website out of billions and pick it apart and in a way learn from someone else.
                    i still need to make my website responsive though q.q ...
                </p>
                <p> i dont really have a big topic to write about but here are some thoughts i had this week:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> the way soap breaks down after multiple uses is kind of like a binary tree </li>
                    <li> its crazy to me that at the panda express on campus an order of orange and teriyaki chicken is so common that the two girls working behind the counter looked at each other, smiled, and finished my order before i could by abbreviating my order as "orangeteri" </li>
                    <li>to do: make the blog an actual blog with comments, db, and markup instead of just markup :-^></li>
                </ul>
                </section>

           <div class="footer">
